Task101-2


Now calculate a suitable current limiting resistor value for the RED and AMBER LEDs in your kit. The data is below

Colour	current (approx.)	Voltage
RED	    2mA	                1.7V
AMBER	  2mA	               1.85V

V = IR rearranged to V/I = R

RED   - 1.7 V/0.02 Amps = 85 Ohms
AMBER - 1.85 V/0.02 Amps = 92.5 Ohms
